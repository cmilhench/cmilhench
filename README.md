Hello, my name is **Colin**. I'm a Staff Engineer and Cloud Architect with deep experience in designing and 
delivering **cloud-native architectures** for SaaS applications.

I specialize in **SaaS**, **multi-tenancy**, system reliability, and cloud
migrations. Working hands-on to solve complex technical challenges while
mentoring teams and shaping engineering practices.

My career spans over two decades, building scalable, secure, and efficient
solutions for distributed systems, leveraging technologies like **AWS**,
**Go**, and working with **NoSQL** storage.
